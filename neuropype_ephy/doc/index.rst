NeuroDaddy documentation
************************

NeuroDaddy is an open-source multi-modal brain data analysis kit which provides **Python-based 
pipelines** for advanced multi-thread processing of fMRI, MEG and EEG data, with a focus on connectivity 
and graph analyses. NeuroDaddy is based on `Nipype <http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#>`_,
a tool developed in fMRI field, which facilitates data analyses by wrapping many commonly-used neuro-imaging software into a common
python framework.

NeuroDaddy project includes two different packages:

* :ref:`ephypype` based on `MNE python <http://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html>`_ includes pipelines for electrophysiology analysis
* graphpype based on `radatools <http://deim.urv.cat/~sergio.gomez/radatools.php>`_ includes pipelines for graph theoretical analysis of neuroimaging data 

NeuroDaddy provides a very common and fast framework to develop workflows for advanced analyses, in particular
defines a set of different pipelines that can be used stand-alone or as lego of a bigger workflow:
the input of a pipeline will be the output of another pipeline. 

For each possible workflow the input data can be specified in three different ways: 

* raw MEG data in .fif and .ds format 
* time series of connectivity matrices in .mat (Matlab) or .npy (Numpy) format
* connectivity matrices in .mat (Matlab) or .npy (Numpy) format

   Main inputs and subsequent pipeline steps

Each pipeline based on nipype engine is defined by nodes connected together, 
where each node maybe wrapping of existing software (as MNE-python modules or radatools functions) 
as well as providing easy ways to implement function defined by the user.
